My name is William Lighter, and I am an investor in Blue Sky Mines.  I am a huge fan of Doctor Who and the Doctor Who spin-off, and I would love to see a spin-off about the Doctor.  My wife, Chelse, would be delighted.  We have many fans in the mines who would be very interested in a Doctor Who spin-off, and I have a wife and daughter who write Doctor Who fan magazines (The Doctor Who E-Mails, and the Doctor Who Is-It-Written.com).  The daughter Chelse forwarded your e-mail to us, and I am very impressed by your dedication to our organization.  Keep in mind we are a 501(c)(3) 501(c)(3) charity, so donations are not tax deductible, and I would be able to write to your corporate offices very easily. \n \nI would be able to write to you from my home, as I am not sure of where I reside.  I am sure that you can reach me at my current address.  I will be glad to hear from you again.  I am also very interested in your proposition, but as you did not provide any definite addresses, I will hesitate to make any more detailed donations.  If you address me as William Lighter, please also provide a clear address.\t\n \nGod bless you, William Lighter\n \nW.L. Scopp","time":"7/5/2020, 2:46:03 PM"}]
