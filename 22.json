I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of $11.3million immediately to your private account.The money has been here in our Bank lying dormant for years now without anybody coming for the claim of it.\r\n\r\nI want to release the money to you as the relative to our deceased customer (the account owner) who died a long with his supposed NEXT OF KIN since 16th October 2005. The Banking laws here does not allow such money to stay more than 14 years, because the money will be recalled to the Bank treasury account as unclaimed fund.\r\n\r\nBy indicating your interest I will send you the full details on how the business will be executed.\r\n\r\nPlease respond urgently and delete if you are not interested.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nMr. Ahmed Hassan.","time":"7/5/2020, 2:45:05 PM"},{"sender":"baiter","subject":"Re: With due respect.","mailbody":"Hi,\nSounds great, how can we proceed?
