[{"sender":"scammer","subject":"Dear Beloved","mailbody":"My Beloved In The Lord.\r\n\r\nMy name is Mrs Margret Nelson, I am a dying woman who had decided to\r\ndonate what I have to the Charities. I am 85 years old and was\r\ndiagnosed for cancer about four years ago, immediately after the death\r\nof my husband; I have been touched to donate from what I have\r\ninherited from my late husband for the good work rather than allow his\r\nrelatives to use my husband's hard earned fund.\r\n\r\nAs I lay on the sick bed, I want you to help me in carrying out my\r\nlast wish on earth which will be very profitable to you. I want to\r\nWILL a total sum of $5.5 million USD to you which I want you to\r\ndistribute part of it to any charity home for me and the rest for\r\nyourself and your family which I will inform you on how to share all,\r\nplease for further information contact me ASAP.\r\n\r\nPlease reply with my private email address. margretnelson@gmail.co.za\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nMrs Margret Nelson","time":"7/6/2020, 11:16:17 PM"},{"sender":"baiter","subject":"Re: Dear Beloved","mailbody":"01 Jul 2003, 02:35:26 AM \n\n My friend i must tell the bank that due to the fact that you are clean of habit and reputation, untainted by any personal adventure with woman of a loose kind and with unimpeachable vimtos.
